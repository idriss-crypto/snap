# IDriss Multi Resolver Snap

This snap can be used to resolve several naming services in the sending input field of your MetaMask wallet. 

## Testing

The snap comes with some basic tests, to demonstrate how to write tests for
snaps. To test the snap, run `yarn test` in this directory. This will use
[`@metamask/snaps-jest`](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/tree/main/packages/snaps-jest)
to run the tests in `src/index.test.ts`.
